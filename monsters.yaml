     An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns,
     ending the effect on itself on a success.

   This monstrosity is nothing but mouths;
   eight tentacles, each tipped with a snapping mouth,
   emerge from a round body with a single, massive maw.

     Although null beholders bear some resemblance to normal beholders,
     their behaviors differ wildly. A null beholder has little concern for its personal safety,
     staying to fight obviously superior forces if there is a chance that it gets to eat fresh meat.

    text: >
     Some scholars theorize that null beholders result from
     a regular beholder being bathed in negative energy;
     others postulate that they form when a true beholder dreams of starvation.

     Null beholders rarely establish a permanent lair and do not seek out servants,
     but will accept any creature that decides to follow and worship it.
     A null beholder spends most of its time prowling through dark places in search of its next meal.

  - name: multiattack
