    reach: 10
    target: two targets
    onhit: >

     The beholder heals an amount equal to the amount of necrotic damage dealt.
  - name: Maw
    type: mw
    ability: dex
    reach: 5
    target: one target
    onhit: "[diceroll 4 10 dex] slashing damage plus [diceroll 2 6 0] acid damage."

  - name: Venomous Bites
    type: mw
    ability: dex
    reach: 10
    target: two targets
    onhit: >
     [diceroll 4 4 dex] slashing damage
     plus [diceroll 1 6 0] poison damage
     plus [diceroll 1 4 0] necrotic damage,
     and the target must succeed on a [save w/con con] or be poisoned.
     While poisoned in this way, a creature takes [diceroll 1 4 0] poison damage
     plus [diceroll 1 4 0] necrotic damage at the start of each of their turns, and cannot cast spells.
     An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns,
     ending the effect on itself on a success.
  habitat:
  - underground
  flavor: >
   This monstrosity is nothing but mouths;
   eight tentacles, each tipped with a snapping mouth,
   emerge from a round body with a single, massive maw.
  description:
  - header: Distant Relatives
    text: >
     Although null beholders bear some resemblance to normal beholders,
     their behaviors differ wildly. A null beholder has little concern for its personal safety,
     staying to fight obviously superior forces if there is a chance that it gets to eat fresh meat.
  - header: Unknown Origins
    text: >
     Some scholars theorize that null beholders result from
     a regular beholder being bathed in negative energy;
     others postulate that they form when a true beholder dreams of starvation.
  - header: Tireless Hunters
    text: >
     Null beholders rarely establish a permanent lair and do not seek out servants,
     but will accept any creature that decides to follow and worship it.
     A null beholder spends most of its time prowling through dark places in search of its next meal.
  actions:
  - name: multiattack
    effect: The null beholder makes one maw attack and two other melee attacks.
# STONE SLUG ####################################################################

  - name: Soft-bodied
    effect: >
     The stone slug can fit into a space small enough for a Medium creature
     without squeezing.
  - name: Stone Eater
    effect: >
     The stone slug can burrow through solid rock at half their burrow speed,
     leaving a tunnel a little bit less than 10 feet in diameter behind.
  attacks:
  - name: Flail
    type: mw
    ability: str
    reach: 5
    target: one target
    onhit: >
     [diceroll 1 10 str] bludgeoning damage.
  - name: Grinding Bite
    type: mw
    ability: str
    reach: 5
    target: one target
    onhit: >
     [diceroll 2 4 str] slashing damage. If the target is wearing non-magical body
     armor, they must succeed on a [save w/dex str] or their armor is damaged.
     Damaged armor's AC is reduced by one until it is repaired. This damage
     reduction is not cumulative.
  habitat:
  - underground
  flavor: This enormous slug is covered with grey, stonelike armor plates.
  description:
  - header: Rock Eaters
    text: >
     Stone slugs are omnivores, but can also subsist on the rock they burrow
     through. Much like purple worms, they can leave undigested gemstones
     in their wake.
  - header: Food for Worms
    text: >
     Stone slugs are a favored prey of purple worms. As a result of this
     predation, they have developed a strong resistance to poison. Other
     creatures that dwell underground tend to leave the slugs alone,
     because most creatures think they taste horrible.
# HEDGEHOG GOBLIN ###########################################

     escape. Treat the area within 5 feet of the goblin's body as
     filled with caltrops until the end of the next round.
  - name: Expert Thrower
    effect: >
     The hedgehog goblin adds double its proficiency bonus to
     attacks made with thrown weapons.

    type: mw
    ability: dex
    reach: 5
    target: one target
    onhit: "[diceroll 1 4 dex] bludgeoning damage"
  flavor: >
   This goblin is just like any other... except that it
   carries a bag full of hedgehogs, which it can throw with
   perfect accuracy.
  habitat:
  - grasslands
  - underground
  description:
  - header: Masterful Thrower
    text: >
     Hedgehog goblins are uncannily good at throwing things,
     especially hedgehogs. Especially creative chieftains
     can give their hedgehog goblins more dangerous projectiles,
     such as experimental grenades, to take advantage of their
     unusual skill.
  - header: Obsessed with Hedgehogs
    text: >
     As their name would suggest, hedgehog goblins are totally obsessed with
     hedgehogs. Most of their time is spent scouring the area around the
     goblin's lair for new hedgehogs to add to their collection.
     Hedgehog goblins do not take particularly good care of their hedgehogs,
     though; they just keep them alive long enough to find something to throw
     them at.

  abilities:
  - name: Cyclical Immunities
    effect: >

     is in addition to any other immunities.
  - name: Glow
    effect: >
     A gloamwing sheds bright light for 10 feet and dim light
     for an additional 20 feet. This light is golden in color
     during the day, and silver at night.

    ability: dex
    reach: 5
    target: one target
    onhit: >
     [diceroll 1 4 dex] radiant damage, plus one fire damage during
     the day, or one cold damage at night.
  flavor: >
   A glowing shape, similar to a huge swallowtail butterfly, glides
   past. It seems to swim through the air on glimmering wings.
  description:
  - header: Spirits of the Sun and Stars
    text: >
     Gloamwings are classified as elementals, but are intimately
     connected to the movements of the sun and moon. Their migration
     patterns follow the paths of celestial objects, and their glow
     changes from a brilliant golden color during the day to a solemn
     silver tone at night. During dusk and dawn, gloamwings of both
     hues can be seen, mingling the light of the sun and moon.
# DARKTAINT GLOAMWING #######################################################

    effect: >
     The darktaint gloamwing reduces the light level of non-magical
     light by one in a 10-foot radius around it (bright light becomes
     dim light and dim light becomes darkness). While in natural darkness
     (before the reduction), the gloamwing can take the Hide action as a
     bonus action.
  - name: Sunlight Sensitivity
  attacks:
  - name: Draining Touch
    type: mw
    ability: dex
    reach: 5
    target: one target
    onhit: "[diceroll 1 4 dex] necrotic damage."
  flavor: A batlike shred of shadow flutters through the air, casting a shroud of darkness around it.
  description:
  - header: Corrupted Gloamwings
    text: >
     A gloamwing deprived too long of natural light, or one exposed to energies
     from the Plane of Shadow, becomes a twisted, evil creature of darkness.
     Although not particularly dangerous individually, swarms of tainted
     gloamwings pose a significant threat to travelers after dark.
# ANCIENT ZINC DRAGON ####################################

     melee weapon suffers [diceroll 2 12 0] lightning damage. This effect
     extends to include any conductive material that the dragon is touching.
     For example, if the zinc dragon was in contact with a pool of water,
