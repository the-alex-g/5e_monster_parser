     An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns,
     ending the effect on itself on a success.
  habitat:
  - underground
  flavor: >
   This monstrosity is nothing but mouths;
   eight tentacles, each tipped with a snapping mouth,
   emerge from a round body with a single, massive maw.

    text: >
     Although null beholders bear some resemblance to normal beholders,
     their behaviors differ wildly. A null beholder has little concern for its personal safety,
     staying to fight obviously superior forces if there is a chance that it gets to eat fresh meat.
  - header: Unknown Origins
    text: >
     Some scholars theorize that null beholders result from
     a regular beholder being bathed in negative energy;
     others postulate that they form when a true beholder dreams of starvation.
  - header: Tireless Hunters
    text: >
     Null beholders rarely establish a permanent lair and do not seek out servants,
     but will accept any creature that decides to follow and worship it.
     A null beholder spends most of its time prowling through dark places in search of its next meal.
  actions:
  - name: multiattack
    effect: The null beholder makes one maw attack and two other melee attacks.

    reach: 5
    target: one target
    onhit: >
     [diceroll 2 4 str] slashing damage. If the target is wearing non-magical body
     armor, they must succeed on a [save w/dex str] or their armor is damaged.
     Damaged armor's AC is reduced by one until it is repaired. This damage
     reduction is not cumulative.
  habitat:
  - underground
  flavor: This enormous slug is covered with grey, stonelike armor plates.
  description:
  - header: Rock Eaters
    text: >
     Stone slugs are omnivores, but can also subsist on the rock they burrow
     through. Much like purple worms, they can leave undigested gemstones
     in their wake.
  - header: Worm Prey
    text: >
     Stone slugs are a favored prey of purple worms. As a result of this
     predation, they have developed a strong resistance to poison. Other
     creatures that dwell underground tend to leave the slugs alone,
     because most creatures think they taste horrible.
