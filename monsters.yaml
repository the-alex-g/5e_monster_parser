    text: >
     Zinc dragons are unpredictable, jumping from one thing to
     another with little regard for anything other than their
     immediate interests. However, they are also exceedingly
     vain and take great pride in their acrobatic skill and
     mirrorlike scales. Any creature that compliments them
     often and profusely stays in their good graces longer than
     they would otherwise.
  - header: Desert Dwellers
    text: >
     Zinc dragons live in the deepest parts of the desert,
     usually establishing their lairs far from any settlements.
     Occasionally, blue dragons and zinc dragons fight over
     territory, but such conflicts are relatively rare.
  - header: Hatred of Water
    text: >
     Zinc dragons have an intense fear of water, stemming from
     the fact that any large amount of water sears their scales
     like acid. They go to great lengths to ensure that no one
     brings water into their domain.

    text: >
     Although null beholders bear some resemblance to normal beholders,
     their behaviors differ wildly. A null beholder has little concern for its personal safety,
     staying to fight obviously superior forces if there is a chance that it gets to eat fresh meat.
  - header: Unknown Origins
    text: >
     Some scholars theorize that null beholders result from
     a regular beholder being bathed in negative energy;
     others postulate that they form when a true beholder dreams of starvation.
  - header: Tireless Hunters
    text: >
     Null beholders rarely establish a permanent lair and do not seek out servants,
     but will accept any creature that decides to follow and worship it.
     A null beholder spends most of its time prowling through dark places in search of its next meal.

     Stone slugs are a favored prey of purple worms. As a result of this
     predation, they have developed a strong resistance to poison. Other

     Hedgehog goblins are uncannily good at throwing things,
     especially hedgehogs. Especially creative chieftains
     can give their hedgehog goblins more dangerous projectiles,
     such as experimental grenades, to take advantage of their
     unusual skill.
  - header: Obsessed with Hedgehogs

     As their name would suggest, hedgehog goblins are totally obsessed with
     hedgehogs. Most of their time is spent scouring the area around the
     goblin's lair for new hedgehogs to add to their collection.
     Hedgehog goblins do not take particularly good care of their hedgehogs,
     though; they just keep them alive long enough to find something to throw
     them at.

     patterns follow the paths of celestial objects, and their glow

  flavor: Everything about this tree is red---the bark is reddish-brown, the leaves are a dull red, and scarlet sap drips from the boughs.

    text: >
     Bloodbough shamblers constantly drip blood-red acidic sap from their branches,
     killing off all other growth around them. This sap is also highly flammable,
     so lighting fires near bloodboughs is inadvisable.
  - header: Edible Nuts
    text: >
     Nuts from bloodbough trees are bright red and cashew-shaped, and also highly toxic.
     Eating a nut raw causes 3 (1d6) poison damage and 5 (2d4) acid damage.
     However, cooking the nuts renders them edible, and they are considered a delicacy in many places.
     The most popular way to serve them is to roast them for a short time, but at a very
     high temperature, so they acquire some surface charring without turning the entire nut
     into a lump of charcoal. A single bloodbough tree yields about 34 (4d6 + 20) pounds of nuts,
     with a pound of nuts being worth about 2 gc. Thick gloves are necessary in order to harvest
     the nuts without losing digits to the acidic sap.

    text: >
     Fireroot trees grow in the far north, where their heat-generating root tips
     allow them to extract nutrients from the frozen soil. 5 (2d4) root bulbs
     can be harvested from a dead fireroot tree. A root bulb can be used like a club
     (1d6 bludgeoning damage plus 1 fire damage) and sheds dim light in a
     5-foot radius. A bulb loses its glow and fire damage after 4 (1d4 + 2) hours.

    text: >
     Ripe berries from a fireroot tree are bright, almost glowing orange, and quite tasty.
     When eaten, they grant the eater cold resistance for 5 (2d4) hours. Unripe berries
     are blue, ice-cold, extremely sour, and if eaten give the eater cold vulnerability for
     5 (2d4) hours. Ripe berries are a valuable commodity in the northlands, and unripe
     ones can fetch a high price in southern regions.
