     [diceroll 4 4 dex] slashing damage
     plus [diceroll 1 6 0] poison damage
     plus [diceroll 1 4 0] necrotic damage,
     and the target must succeed on a [save w/con con] or be poisoned.
     While poisoned in this way, a creature takes [diceroll 1 4 0] poison damage
     plus [diceroll 1 4 0] necrotic damage at the start of each of their turns, and cannot cast spells.
     An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns,
     ending the effect on itself on a success.
  habitat:
  - underground
  flavor: >
   This monstrosity is nothing but mouths;
   eight tentacles, each tipped with a snapping mouth,
   emerge from a round body with a single, massive maw.

    text: >
     Although null beholders bear some resemblance to normal beholders,
     their behaviors differ wildly. A null beholder has little concern for its personal safety,
     staying to fight obviously superior forces if there is a chance that it gets to eat fresh meat.
  - header: Unknown Origins
    text: >
     Some scholars theorize that null beholders result from
     a regular beholder being bathed in negative energy;
     others postulate that they form when a true beholder dreams of starvation.
  - header: Tireless Hunters
    text: >
     Null beholders rarely establish a permanent lair and do not seek out servants,
     but will accept any creature that decides to follow and worship it.
     A null beholder spends most of its time prowling through dark places in search of its next meal.
  actions:
  - name: multiattack
    effect: The null beholder makes one maw attack and two other melee attacks.

  - name: Stone Eater
    effect: >
     The stone slug can burrow through solid rock at half their burrow speed,
     leaving a tunnel a little bit less than 10 feet in diameter behind.

    ability: str
    reach: 5
    target: one target
    onhit: >
     [diceroll 1 10 str] bludgeoning damage.
  - name: Grinding Bite
    type: mw
    ability: str
    reach: 5
    target: one target
    onhit: >
     [diceroll 2 4 str] slashing damage. If the target is wearing non-magical body
     armor, they must succeed on a [save w/dex str] or their armor is damaged.
     Damaged armor's AC is reduced by one until it is repaired. This damage
     reduction is not cumulative.
  habitat:
  - underground
  flavor: This enormous slug is covered with grey, stonelike armor plates.
  description:
  - header: Rock Eaters
    text: >
     Stone slugs are omnivores, but can also subsist on the rock they burrow
     through. Much like purple worms, they can leave undigested gemstones
     in their wake.
  - header: Food for Worms
    text: >
     Stone slugs are a favored prey of purple worms. As a result of this
     predation, they have developed a strong resistance to poison. Other
     creatures that dwell underground tend to leave the slugs alone,
     because most creatures think they taste horrible.

   carries a bag full of hedgehogs, which it can throw with
   perfect accuracy.
  habitat:
  - grasslands
  - underground
  description:
  - header: Masterful Thrower
    text: >
     Hedgehog goblins are uncannily good at throwing things,
     especially hedgehogs. Especially creative chieftains
     can give their hedgehog goblins more dangerous projectiles,
     such as experimental grenades, to take advantage of their
     unusual skill.
  - header: Obsessed with Hedgehogs
    text: >
     As their name would suggest, hedgehog goblins are totally obsessed with
     hedgehogs. Most of their time is spent scouring the area around the
     goblin's lair for new hedgehogs to add to their collection.
     Hedgehog goblins do not take particularly good care of their hedgehogs,
     though; they just keep them alive long enough to find something to throw
     them at.
