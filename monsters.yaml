     plus [diceroll 1 4 0] necrotic damage,
     and the target must succeed on a [save w/con con] or be poisoned.

     An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns,
     ending the effect on itself on a success.
  flavor: >
   This monstrosity is nothing but mouths;
   eight tentacles, each tipped with a snapping mouth,
   emerge from a round body with a single, massive maw.

    text: >
     Although null beholders bear some resemblance to normal beholders,
     their behaviors differ wildly. A null beholder has little concern for its personal safety,
     staying to fight obviously superior forces if there is a chance that it gets to eat fresh meat.
  - header: Unknown Origins
    text: >
     Some scholars theorize that null beholders result from
     a regular beholder being bathed in negative energy;
     others postulate that they form when a true beholder dreams of starvation.
  - header: Tireless Hunters
    text: >
     Null beholders rarely establish a permanent lair and do not seek out servants,
     but will accept any creature that decides to follow and worship it.
     A null beholder spends most of its time prowling through dark places in search of its next meal.
  actions:
  - name: multiattack
    effect: The null beholder makes one maw attack and two other melee attacks.
