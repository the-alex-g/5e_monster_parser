description:
- header: Shock Troops
  text: >
    Nightmares are the elite soldiers of the amnio armies, serving as shock troops and bodyguards for the conduits.
    They are also quite intelligent, and often command swarms of fragments and scourges in combat.

    Uniquely among amnio, nightmares have no ability to destroy their enemies’ intellect; instead,
    they specialize in annihilating their bodies.
