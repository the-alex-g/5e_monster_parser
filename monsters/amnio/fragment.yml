description:
- header: Expendable Minions
  text: Fragments are the weakest of the amnio, and, along with the scourges, form the bulk of the amnio hordes.

  text: >
    Fragments are created from snippets of thought that would otherwise be discarded by the more powerful amnio,
    almost as a byproduct of creating more other amnio. As a result of their incidental nature, fragments are neither
    intelligent nor powerful.
