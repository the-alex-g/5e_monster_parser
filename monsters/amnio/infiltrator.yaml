- name: Mimicry
  effect: >
    The infiltrator can mimic a person that a creature within 30 ft has a memory of. The mimicry is fairly accurate, requiring a
    [check 12 perception] to detect any physical inaccuracies. Creatures who know the mimicked person well are likely
    to notice behavioral differences as well. The infiltrator reverts to its natural form when it dies. While mimicking a creature,
    the infiltrator uses its own stats, but has access to all weapon attacks that creature would normally have, and can understand
    all languages that the mimicked creature could speak.

  Unlike most amnio, this one is clearly humanoid in silhouette. Like the erasers, where a personâ€™s face should be,
  there is a blank white mask.

    Using their ability to mimic humanoids with reasonable accuracy, infiltrators were able to bypass security measures that were
    thought insurmountable, often retrieving secrets without anyone knowing that they had been and gone.

    Creatures that stand near an infiltrator have a hard time thinking straight, with their minds feeling fuzzy as if they were drunk.
    However, affected creatures rarely suspect the true cause of their difficulty.
