  text: >
   Goldweavers are mostly composed of pure gold, and some specimens have bits of gemstones or other precious metals embedded in them.
   Goldweavers spin fine webs of pure gold, which can then be harvested and sold. A single dead goldweaver will fetch at least 5 gc
   based on the precious metal content, and live ones are worth upward of 50 gc.

   Although tiny and easily killed, goldweavers have incredibly potent venom. Anyone who keeps goldweavers must take great care to avoid
   being bitten while harvesting their webs. Many alchemists would like to study goldweaver venom and are willing to pay a large sum
   for a venom sample.
