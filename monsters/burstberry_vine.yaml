- header: Explosive Berries
  text: >
   The distinctive berries of a burstberry vine explode violently at the slightest touch. Many people have tried to harvest the berries,
   but so far, no one has found a way to collect them without them exploding... or even a way to get close enough to the vine without
   being attacked.

   Burstberry vines seem to be able to absorb electrical energy to fuel their explosive berries. Because of this affinity, some
   scholars suggest that the vines may be distantly related to shambling mounds. Indeed, there have been somewhat disturbing reports
   of the two creatures forming a symbiotic relationship, with burstberry vines growing atop shambling mounds.
