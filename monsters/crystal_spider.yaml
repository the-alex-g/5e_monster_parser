  effect: >
   After each long rest, a creature afflicted with crystalline disease must make a [save w/con con]. On a success, nothing happens. On
   a failure, the disease stage increases by one. The disease starts at stage 0, which has no effect. See the list below for the effect
   of each stage. Note that the effects are cumulative: a creature with stage 3 disease suffers from the effects of stages 1-3.
   [numberlist
   Small crystals begin to grow on the afflicted creature's skin. When the creature's disease stage increases, the creature takes
   [diceroll 1 4] necrotic damage. &
   The crystals begin to hamper the creature's movement, reducing its Dex score by one. &
   The crystals increase in thickness, reducing the creature's Dex score by one. The creature's AC cannot be less than 13, regardless
   of what armor they might be wearing. &

description:
- header: Crystal Tenders
  text: >
   Crystal spiders care for groves of crystals deep underground. They have the ability to extrude crystalline material, but only rarely
   do they spin it into anything resembling a traditional spiderweb, instead preferring to craft beautiful gemstone nodules on every
   available surface.

  text: >
   The bite of a crystal spider inflicts a disease that slowly turns the afflicted creature into a crystalline statue. The spiders seem
   to find the organic shapes of crystallized prey unattractive, because they always consume such unfortunate creatures and use them as
   raw building material for their favorite geometric patterns.
- header: Valuable Commodity
  text: >
   Crystal spiders are highly valuable, with live specimens worth upwards of 100 gc, and dead ones still being worth at least 30 gc.
   Many underdark races trade in crystal spiders, but the spiders are hard to find and defend their homes tenaciously.

   Crystal spiders were probably created from a mundane variety of spider that was warped by elemental energy.
