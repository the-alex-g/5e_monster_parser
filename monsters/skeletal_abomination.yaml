description:
- header: Bone Amalgamation
  text: >
   Skeletal abominations are created from several creature's remains, occasionally arising out of mass graves. They are, like most
   undead, mindless brutes bent on the destruction of all life.

  text: >
   Because skeletal abominations are made from a patchwork of bones, they are less structurally sound than regular skeletons.
   Heavy damage to a skeletal abomination can cause bones to break off, reducing the abomination's combat effectiveness. However,
   few soldiers can survive a fight with a skeletal abomination long enough to incapacitate it.

   Skeletal abominations are less reliable than most undead; they have even been known to ignore orders if they have a chance to
   destroy something living. In combat, they simply charge into the fight and try to inflict as much damage as possible before they
   are destroyed.
