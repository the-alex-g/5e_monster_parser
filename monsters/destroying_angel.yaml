  effect: The destroying angel makes four dread blade attacks, or two dread blade attacks and either a Deadly Spores or Purge action.
- name: Deadly Spores
  uses: recharge 4-6
  effect: >
   The area within 15 feet of the destroying angel becomes suffused with poisonous spores. Any living creatures that start or end
   their turns in that area must make a [save w/con con] or become poisoned. Creatures that do not need to breathe or are holding their
   breath have advantage on their save. While poisoned in this way, a creature takes [diceroll 4 6] poison damage at the start of each of
   its turns. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
   The spore cloud remains for [diceroll 2 6] rounds, or until dispersed by strong wind.
- name: Purge
  uses: recharge 6
  effect: >
   All creatures in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within 60 feet of the destroying angel take [diceroll 3 8] radiant damage
   plus [diceroll 3 8] radiant damage for each of the following conditions that the creature has: frightened, poisoned, and paralyzed.
   A successful [save w/cha wis] halves the damage. All affected creatures lose their frightened, poisoned, and paralyzed conditions,
   and any non-magical diseases they are suffering from are cured.
attacks:
- name: Dread Blade
  type: mw
  ability: str
  reach: 10
  target: one target
  onhit: >
   [diceroll 1 12 str] slashing damage and the target must make a [save w/con con], taking [diceroll 2 6] poison damage and [diceroll 2 6]
   necrotic damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success. If the creature fails the saving throw, it becomes frightened of the
   destroying angel. If it is already frightened and poisoned, it becomes paralyzed. At the start of the creatureâ€™s turn, it can repeat
   the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.
flavor: Countless diaphanous wings frame this many-limbed fungal horror.

  text: >
   These hulking fey serve as harbingers of death and decay, annihilating entire villages with their ability to spread fear and poison.
   A destroying angel will use its terrifying swords and toxic spores to incapacitate its opponents, and then finish them off by searing
   the disease from their flesh.
