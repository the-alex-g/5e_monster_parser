abilities:
- name: False Appearance
  effect: >
    While motionless, the algae bloom is indistinguishable from an ordinary
    mat of pond scum or algae.
- name: Radiance Absorption
  effect: >
    When the algae bloom would suffer radiant damage, it gains temporary hit points
    and regains hit points, both equal to half the damage it would have taken (even
    though the algae bloom is a swarm). The temporary hit points last for one minute.
- name: Torpor
  effect: >
    If the algae bloom suffers 10 or more cold damage in a single round, it enters a
    state of torpor. While in torpor, the algae bloom loses its cold and necrotic
    vulnerabilities, its movement speed is halved, its Dexterity score is reduced to
    7 (-2), and it makes attacks with disadvantage. If the algae bloom takes 10 or more
    fire and/or radiant damage in a single round while in torpor, it exits torpor.

    [diceroll 1 4] poison damage and the target must succeed on a [save w/con con] or
    become poisoned. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each
    of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

description:
- header: Lake Hazard
  text: >
    Algae blooms dwell in lakes, ponds, rivers, and swamps throughout the land. Since an
    algae bloom looks exactly like an ordinary mat of pond scum, an infestation is rarely
    noticed until it is too late.

  text: >
    Although vulnerable to cold, algae blooms have developed a way to survive the frigid
    winters of the northern regions: when the weather turns cold, algae blooms enter a
    state of torpor, protecting them from the worst of the winter cold. However, a torpid
    algae bloom is much less dangerous than a fully awake one.
