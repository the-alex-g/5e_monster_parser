   Some boneplate skeletons have their bones coated in a black alchemical substance that offers additional protection. These skeletons
   have resistance to piercing and slashing from non-magical weapons.
flavor: The faces of these skeletons are covered with masks of bone, formed from the back of their skulls. They advance with the coordination of trained soldiers.

  text: >
   Boneplate skeletons have been trained to fight by being instilled with images of thousands of battles fought between warriors of old.
   As a result of this programming, they are deadly opponents when confronted with traditional techniques, but can be hopelessly confused
   by a unique fighting style.

   Created to be an invincible fighting force, it is impossible to stop a boneplate skeleton from carrying out its orders without
   destroying it. More than one cleric has been killed by a legion of boneplate skeletons after their attempts at turning proved useless.
