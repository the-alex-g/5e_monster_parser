  effect: >
   The darkling ooze sheds dim light in a 15-foot radius. This light counts as sunlight for the purposes of light sensitivites or
   weaknesses. The ooze can turn this light on or off at any time.

   Whenever the darkling ooze takes radiant damage, it gains temporary hit points equal to the amount of damage it took. These temporary
   hit points last for one minute.

   The darkling ooze teleports up to 60 feet in any direction. It can take along one creature that it is grappling.
   Both the start point and the end point must be in darkness.
- name: Eldritch Discharge
  effect: >
   The darkling ooze suddenly emits a blinding flash of unwholesome light. All creatures within 20 feet suffer damage equal to
   the oozeâ€™s temporary hit points and are blinded and poisoned for [diceroll 1 4] rounds. Half of the damage is radiant,
   and half is necrotic. A successful [save w/con con] halves the damage and negates the blindness, but not the poison.
   The ooze then loses all of its temporary hit points.

  text: >
   Darkling oozes prowl the Underdark, where their ability to unleash bursts of blinding light is especially devastating to
   the light-sensitive creatures that dwell there. The oozes usually hunt alone, using their fortifying vapors before teleporting
   next to their target and blasting them with eldritch light. If their victim resists their radiant burst or poses a serious threat to
   the ooze, it will teleport away at the nearest opportunity.

  text: >
   A darkling ooze emits a steady, orange glow from its center. This glow makes those who look at it sick, and affects creatures
   with an aversion to sunlight as if it were, in fact, sunlight.
