abilities:

  effect: >
   The first time each round that an intelligent creature touches the moss with its bare skin,
   it is subject to the moss’s Psychic Crush ability.
- name: Fragile Intellect
  effect: >
   For every 8 points of damage the cipher moss has suffered, its Int and Wis scores are reduced by one, to a minimum of [stat 1]
   for Int or [stat 10] for Wis.
- name: Low Profile
  effect: >
   The cipher moss covers the surface that it grows on, but because it is no more than a foot deep, other creatures can move through
   the space it occupies as if it were difficult terrain. Until the moss makes its powers known, it looks like an ordinary bed of moss.
   It can be identified with a successful [check 16 nature].
actions:
- name: Absorb Thoughts
  effect: >
   One living creature within 60 feet of the moss must make an Intelligence saving throw, where the DC is equal to 10 + the moss’s Int
   bonus. If the creature fails its save, the moss regains [diceroll 1 12 con] hit points. If the moss gains at least 10 hit points, its Int
   score increases by one. If the moss’s Wis score is less than its Int score after the Int increase, the moss’s Wis score also increases
   by one. Both scores have a maximum of 20.
- name: Psychic Crush
  effect: >
   One creature within 60 feet of the moss must make an Intelligence saving throw, where the DC is equal to 10 + the moss’s Int bonus.
   If the creature fails the check, it takes 8d6 psychic damage and is stunned for one minute. At the end of each of the creature’s turns,
   it can repeat the saving throw, ending the stunned effect on a success. On a success, the creature takes half as much damage and may
   make a second saving throw. If this second saving throw succeeds, the creature gets a +1 bonus to Int and Wis checks for the next 24
   hours. This bonus is not cumulative.
attacks:

  type: mw
  ability: str
  reach: 0
  target: one creature in the moss' space.
  onhit: >
   [diceroll 2 6 str] bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled by the moss. While the target is grappled, it is also
   restrained, and takes [diceroll 1 6] bludgeoning damage at the start of each of the moss’s turns. The moss can have up to one
   Large creature, four Medium or Small creatures, or sixteen Tiny creatures enveloped at the same time.
reactions:
- name: Spell Mimicry
  effect: >
   This reaction can be taken when another creature casts a spell within 60 feet of the moss. The moss must make an Intelligence check,
   where the DC is 10 + the level of the spell (cantrips are level 0). On a success, the moss memorizes the spell. The moss can cast a
   memorized spell once, and then forgets it. The cipher moss can only have one memorized spell at a time. When casting memorized spells,
   the moss does not require any components. The moss’s spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 10 + Int, spell attack bonus
   2 + Int).
flavor: This thick bed of dark green moss appears no different from any other at first sight, but any creature that touches it is crushed under the weight of a thousand years of memories.

- header: Knowledge Harvesters
  text: >
   Cipher mosses absorb and record the thoughts, words, and actions of those around them. Any creature that touches a cipher moss can
   then extract the information stored within. This means that small patches of cipher moss are extremely useful for spying on people,
   and are often planted by unsavory characters in places where sensitive information is likely to be shared. However, a patch of moss
   left unattended will start to grow, albeit slowly; after a few centuries, cipher mosses can reach incredible sizes. As the size of the
   moss increases, so does its capacity to store information. Eventually, the moss evolves a rudimentary self-awareness.

   Although ancient cipher mosses are extremely intelligent, their minds are very slow, and the things they ponder are incomprehensible to
   other beings. However, it is possible (though difficult) for a person to bargain with one in exchange for information, or simply safe
   passage.

   Cipher mosses are usually content to remain in one place, but are capable of moving at a rate of about 1 foot every hour. A cipher moss
   looks much like any other mat of moss, but can be identified by its darker shade of green and the blueish tips of the newest growth.
