description:
- header: One with the Mountains
  text: >
    An alpine spirit’s appearance and powers shift throughout the day,
    even as the mountain’s do. In the morning, when the mountains are
    bathed in crimson light, the spirit is wreathed in flames. In the
    afternoon, when the mountains are crowned by storm clouds, so is
    the alpine spirit. At night, when the dark mountains blend into the starry
    sky, the alpine spirit blends with the mountains and draws further power
    from its immovable stone.

    Alpine spirits guard the mountain they dwell in from those who would disrespect
    it. Occasionally, dwarves who delve too deep or too greedily awaken the wrath
    of an alpine spirit. Alpine spirits also ward off flying creatures who would
    make their lairs on mountain peaks.
