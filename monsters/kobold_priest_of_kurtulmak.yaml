   The kobold casts [spell imprisonment] (save DC 10), requiring no material components. The type of imprisonment is always Hedged Prison,
   with the prison appearing as a labyrinthine cavern system. The creature is released either after one hour has passed, after a creature
   sacrifices a gnome to Kurtulmak with the intent of releasing the imprisoned creature, or after the kobold priest dies. A creature
   targeted by the spell in this way is immune to further castings by the kobold priest for the next [diceroll 1 4 1] days,
   instead of permanently.
flavor: This kobold wears a green facemask, carries a spear, and has a wicked-looking barb affixed to the tip of its tail.
