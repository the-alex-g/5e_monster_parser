   as small crystals grow from the creature's skin. These crystals reduce the affected creature's Dex score by one, and their AC cannot
   be less than 11. The crystal effect is cumulative, so a creature that had been hit twice would have their Dex score reduced by two and
   a minimum AC of 12. The crystals fall off after 24 hours, or can be removed with any effect that cures disease. If a creature's Dex
   score is reduced to 0 by encrusting crystals, they are paralyzed but not dead.
flavor: This skeleton's bones are encrusted in a layer of crystals.

  text: >
   Crystalline skeletons are formed when a crystal-encrusted skeleton is animated. Sometimes the encrustation is a result of natural
   crystal growth, and sometimes it is a result of magic or disease, such as from the bite of a crystal spider. The skeletons can cause
   crystals to grow on the creatures they attack, but such encrustation is only temporary.
