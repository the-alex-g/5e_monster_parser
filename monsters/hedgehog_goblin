    Hedgehog goblins are uncannily good at throwing things,
    especially hedgehogs. Especially creative chieftains
    can give their hedgehog goblins more dangerous projectiles,
    such as experimental grenades, to take advantage of their
    unusual skill.
- header: Obsessed with Hedgehogs
  text: >
    As their name would suggest, hedgehog goblins are totally obsessed with
    hedgehogs. Most of their time is spent scouring the area around the
    goblin's lair for new hedgehogs to add to their collection.
    Hedgehog goblins do not take particularly good care of their hedgehogs,
    though; they just keep them alive long enough to find something to throw
    them at.
