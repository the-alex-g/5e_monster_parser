  effect: >
   When a creature within 60 feet of the monkey casts a spell, that creature is cursed. While cursed in this way, any time the creature
   casts a spell, it must make an Intelligence saving throw with a DC equal to 11 + the level of the spell slot being expended
   (0 for cantrips). If the creature fails, the spell is not cast and the action is wasted, but the spell slot is not lost. The
   curse lasts for 24 hours or until removed by a Remove Curse spell or similar magic.

   The [name] were themselves cursed by an ancient pharaoh to guard his tomb. The curse, combined with the dark magic surrounding the
   dead pharaoh's tomb, warped the monkeys, making them far more aggressive and giving them a strong resistance to magic. As a side-effect
   of the curse, the monkeys can now put a curse on those who try to enchant them. This curse makes it far more difficult for the victim
   to cast spells.
