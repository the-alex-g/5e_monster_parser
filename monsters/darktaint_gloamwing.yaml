    The darktaint gloamwing reduces the light level of non-magical
    light by one in a 10-foot radius around it (bright light becomes
    dim light and dim light becomes darkness). While in natural darkness
    (before the reduction), the gloamwing can take the Hide action as a
    bonus action.

  text: >
    A gloamwing deprived too long of natural light, or one exposed to energies
    from the Plane of Shadow, becomes a twisted, evil creature of darkness.
    Although not particularly dangerous individually, swarms of tainted
    gloamwings pose a significant threat to travelers after dark.
