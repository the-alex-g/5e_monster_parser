- header: Strength of Iron
  text: >
   Ironwood trees are extremely tough. The wood is very dense, making it almost impossible to cut or burn, and the waxy blue leaves are
   similarly flame-resistant. However, because of its strength, wood from an ironwood tree is quite profitable for those who manage to
   harvest it. A cord of wood can fetch up to 40 gc.

   Ironwood trees have fist-sized, tough seedpods that explode when heated. When a fire sweeps through the forest, the ironwood seedpods
   explode and spread their seeds across a fairly large area. Someone who tries to set fire to an ironwood tree is often
   unpleasantly surprised by a barrage of seeds.
- header: Waxy Leaves
  text: >
   The leaves of ironwood trees are huge, blue, and covered in a thick, waxy coating. This coating is waterproof and resistant to fire.
   Because of this coating, ironwood leaves are useful for a wide range of things, such as wrappers for alchemical explosives or simple
   cups to hold water. Some chandlers have found a way to remove the wax coating and melt it down, so that it can be turned into
   long-lasting candles.
