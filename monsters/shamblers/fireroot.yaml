description:
- header: Heated Root Tips
  text: >
    Fireroot trees grow in the far north, where their heat-generating root tips
    allow them to extract nutrients from the frozen soil. 5 (2d4) root bulbs
    can be harvested from a dead fireroot tree. A root bulb can be used like a club
    (1d6 bludgeoning damage plus 1 fire damage) and sheds dim light in a
    5-foot radius. A bulb loses its glow and fire damage after 4 (1d4 + 2) hours.
- header: Berries
  text: >
    Ripe berries from a fireroot tree are bright, almost glowing orange, and quite tasty.
    When eaten, they grant the eater cold resistance for 5 (2d4) hours. Unripe berries
    are blue, ice-cold, extremely sour, and if eaten give the eater cold vulnerability for
    5 (2d4) hours. Ripe berries are a valuable commodity in the northlands, and unripe
    ones can fetch a high price in southern regions.
