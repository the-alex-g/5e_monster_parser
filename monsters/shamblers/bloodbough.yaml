description:
- header: Caustic Sap
  text: >
    Bloodbough shamblers constantly drip blood-red acidic sap from their branches,
    killing off all other growth around them. This sap is also highly flammable,
    so lighting fires near bloodboughs is inadvisable.
- header: Edible Nuts
  text: >
    Nuts from bloodbough trees are bright red and cashew-shaped, and also highly toxic.
    Eating a nut raw causes 3 (1d6) poison damage and 5 (2d4) acid damage.
    However, cooking the nuts renders them edible, and they are considered a delicacy in many places.
    The most popular way to serve them is to roast them for a short time, but at a very
    high temperature, so they acquire some surface charring without turning the entire nut
    into a lump of charcoal. A single bloodbough tree yields about 34 (4d6 + 20) pounds of nuts,
    with a pound of nuts being worth about 2 gc. Thick gloves are necessary in order to harvest
    the nuts without losing digits to the acidic sap.
