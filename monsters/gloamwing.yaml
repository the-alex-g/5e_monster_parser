    Gloamwings are classified as elementals, but are intimately
    connected to the movements of the sun and moon. Their migration
    patterns follow the paths of celestial objects, and their glow
    changes from a brilliant golden color during the day to a solemn
    silver tone at night. During dusk and dawn, gloamwings of both
    hues can be seen, mingling the light of the sun and moon.
