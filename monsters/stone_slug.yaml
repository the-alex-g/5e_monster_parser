description:
- header: Rock Eaters
  text: >
    Stone slugs are omnivores, but can also subsist on the rock they burrow
    through. Much like purple worms, they can leave undigested gemstones
    in their wake.
- header: Food for Worms
  text: >
    Stone slugs are a favored prey of purple worms. As a result of this
    predation, they have developed a strong resistance to poison. Other
    creatures that dwell underground tend to leave the slugs alone,
    because most creatures think they taste horrible.
