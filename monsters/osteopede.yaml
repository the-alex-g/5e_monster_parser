  text: >
   Osteopedes are insectile horrors that collect bones from the dead and attach them to their carapace, giving them the appearance
   of being made out of bone. If attacked, and osteopede can detach some of the bones from its shell and release them as a deadly barrage
   of broken bone. Osteopedes haunt locations with plentiful bone supplies, such as old battlefields, catacombs, or even
   village graveyards.

  text: >
   The bite of an osteopede causes the victim's bones to grow unnaturally, eventually incapacitating the unfortunate.
   Some people speculate that osteopedes somehow created the first boneblight skeletons, but so far no solid evidence
   has been found to support this theory.
