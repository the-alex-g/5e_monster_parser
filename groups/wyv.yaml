description:
- header: Colonial Predators
  text: >
   Wyvs live in groups of around a hundred individuals, all living within a huge termite-mound-like structure. The wyvs will attack
   almost any creature that enters their territory, using their poison and large numbers to take down creatures many times bigger than
   themselves.

   Wyvs can fly by means of a gas-filled chamber in their bodies. This chamber looks somewhat like a cobra's hood or a set of wings. If
   their flotation chamber is punctured, wyvs can no longer fly and will be set upon by other colony members before long.

   All wyvs have a mild venom, but a few of them have the ability to spit their venom a short distance. These specialized wyvs are
   hardly more dangerous than their cousins, though.
