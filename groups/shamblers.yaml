   Shamblers are trees that have been granted mobility by some form of magic. Unlike regular awakened trees or treants, a shambler
   has animal-level intelligence, and usually continues its life as a normal tree unless threatened. Druidic groups sometimes create
   groves of shamblers to serve as guardians of forest glades.
