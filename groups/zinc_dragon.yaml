description:
- header: Mercurial Temperament
  text: >
    Zinc dragons are unpredictable, jumping from one thing to
    another with little regard for anything other than their
    immediate interests. However, they are also exceedingly
    vain and take great pride in their acrobatic skill and
    mirrorlike scales. Any creature that compliments them
    often and profusely stays in their good graces longer than
    they would otherwise.
- header: Desert Dwellers
  text: >
    Zinc dragons live in the deepest parts of the desert,
    usually establishing their lairs far from any settlements.
    Occasionally, blue dragons and zinc dragons fight over
    territory, but such conflicts are relatively rare.
- header: Hatred of Water
  text: >
    Zinc dragons have an intense fear of water, stemming from
    the fact that any large amount of water sears their scales
    like acid. They go to great lengths to ensure that no one
    brings water into their domain.
abilities:
- name: Avoidance
- name: Electric Current
  effect: >
    Any creature that touches the zinc dragon or hits it with a metal
    melee weapon suffers [lightning] lightning damage. This effect
    extends to include any conductive material that the dragon is touching.
    For example, if the zinc dragon was in contact with a pool of water,
    and someone jumped into the water, they would be electrocuted. The
    zinc dragon can suppress this effect at any time.
- name: Water Weakness
  effect: >
    At the start of each turn that the dragon is in contact with a significant
    amount of water (submerged, in a rainstorm, was hit with a barrel of water
    fired from a catapult), it takes [waterdamage] necrotic damage.
reactions:
- name: Electric Transfer
  effect: >
    When a creature within 60 feet of the dragon deals lightning damage,
    the dragon can deal [lightning] to that creature.

    The dragon spits a [linelength]-foot-long, 5-foot-wide line of crackling electricity.

    as much with a successful [save w/dex con] saving throw.
lair:
 description: >
  Zinc dragons make their lairs in the driest parts of the desert, usually near mountains or other tall rock formations on which they can live. The area around a zinc dragon’s
  lair is completely devoid of water: there are no oases and it never rains. Because no animals would ever approach the dragon’s lair, zinc dragons must range far afield in
  search of prey.
 actions:
 - name: Desiccate
   effect: >
    All living creatures of the dragon’s choice that are within 60 feet of it take [diceroll 4 8] necrotic damage, or half as much damage with a successful [basicsave w/con 20],
    as moisture is forcibly drawn from their bodies.
 - name: Sandstorm
   effect: >
    A cylinder of whirling sand, 60 feet high and 30 feet in diameter, appears centered on a point the dragon can see. The cylinder remains until initiative count 20 on the
    following round. Whenever a creature enters the cylinder, or starts their turn in the cylinder, that creature suffers [diceroll 2 6] slashing damage. The area of the
    cylinder is heavily obscured.
 - name: Argent Agitation
   effect: >
    Until initiative count 20 on the following round, all attacks made with silver-colored metal weapons have disadvantage, because they are vibrating hard enough to make
    it hard to attack accurately.
 regional-effects:
  effects:
  - name: Arid
    effect: The air within one mile of the dragon’s lair is supernaturally dry, doubling the water requirement of all living creatures.
  - name: Windswept
    effect: Winds are especially strong within three miles of the dragon’s lair, and small sandstorms or tornadoes are common.
  - name: Dancing Silver
    effect: Objects made of silver-colored metal seem to weigh less and quiver as though they’re trying to escape.
  ondeath: >
   If the dragon dies, the dryness and wind level return to normal over the course of [diceroll 1 6 1] days. Immediately when the dragon dies, all objects made out of
   silver-colored metal within three miles of the lair double in weight. Affected objects return to their normal weight over the course of [diceroll 1 4] days.
