description:
- header: Mercurial Temperament
  text: >
    Zinc dragons are unpredictable, jumping from one thing to
    another with little regard for anything other than their
    immediate interests. However, they are also exceedingly
    vain and take great pride in their acrobatic skill and
    mirrorlike scales. Any creature that compliments them
    often and profusely stays in their good graces longer than
    they would otherwise.
- header: Desert Dwellers
  text: >
    Zinc dragons live in the deepest parts of the desert,
    usually establishing their lairs far from any settlements.
    Occasionally, blue dragons and zinc dragons fight over
    territory, but such conflicts are relatively rare.
- header: Hatred of Water
  text: >
    Zinc dragons have an intense fear of water, stemming from
    the fact that any large amount of water sears their scales
    like acid. They go to great lengths to ensure that no one
    brings water into their domain.
abilities:
- name: Avoidance
- name: Electric Current
  effect: >
    Any creature that touches the zinc dragon or hits it with a metal
    melee weapon suffers [lightning] lightning damage. This effect
    extends to include any conductive material that the dragon is touching.
    For example, if the zinc dragon was in contact with a pool of water,
    and someone jumped into the water, they would be electrocuted. The
    zinc dragon can suppress this effect at any time.
- name: Water Weakness
  effect: >
    At the start of each turn that the dragon is in contact with a significant
    amount of water (submerged, in a rainstorm, was hit with a barrel of water
    fired from a catapult), it takes [waterdamage] necrotic damage.
reactions:
- name: Electric Transfer
  effect: >
    When a creature within 60 feet of the dragon deals lightning damage,
    the dragon can deal [lightning] to that creature.
