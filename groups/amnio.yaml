    The amnio are a type of neutral evil fiend that were originally created by the Ivory Mage,
    a wizard-king of some ancient kingdom. He managed to ascend to low-level godhood by harnessing
    the thoughts of his subjects through an arcane ritual, turning their bodies into mindless thralls
    and absorbing their minds to fuel his ascension. The Ivory Mage then proceeded to strip the thoughts
    from other unfortunate beings throughout reality, forming them into fiendish servants.

    Eventually, he managed to harvest enough thoughts to unmoor his citadel of Ishkindil from the Material
    Plane, turning it into a floating fortress capable of shifting between the lower planes.

    The amnio take the form of spiky, spindly beings composed of chitin the color of bleached bone.
    Several types also drip a black, sticky acid from pores on their surface.
abilities:
- name: Memory Pool
  effect: >
    The amnio has a pool of memory points that it can spend at any time to activate one of the effects below.
    Each effect can be activated only once between turns, and no more than 10 memory points can be spent on any
    single effect. The amnio can never have more than [memorymax] memory points at one time.
    [bulletlist
    For each memory point that the amnio spends, it heals 1d4 hit points. &
    One creature within 30 feet of the amnio must make a DC 10 + X Wisdom saving throw,
    taking Xd4 psychic damage on a failure, where X is the number of memory points that the amnio spent. &
    For each memory point that the amnio spends, it gets +1 AC until the start of its next turn. &
    For each memory point that the amnio spends, it gets +1 to any one check or saving throw. Use of this ability must be declared before any dice are rolled. &
    For every two memory points that the amnio spends, it can make one attack.]
actions:
- name: Memory Drain
  effect: >
    Up to [draintargets] humanoids within 30 feet of the amnio must make a [save w/none int], using their highest attribute out
    of Int, Wis, or Cha. If the creature fails the saving throw, the attribute score for the attribute used to make the save is
    reduced by one, to a minimum of one, and the amnio gains one memory point. If the targetâ€™s Int, Wis, and Cha scores are all
    equal to one, the target is dominated by the amnio and forced to obey their commands for as long as all their Int, Wis, and
    Cha scores are equal to one. Every day, if the target is not dominated by an amnio, their lowest attribute score out of Int,
    Wis, or Cha is increased by one, to a maximum of the original value.
